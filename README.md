# Weather App 

Dan Beladev - danbeladev@gmail.com - *Home Assignment - Moveo*

This app is written in React & NodeJS and it simulates a world weather application without an API

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Run the app from the `https://github.com/DanBeladev/weather-app---web-crawl---cheerio.git` repository:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server should now run locally on port 3001 and clien on port 3000

You can access it from the browser via: `http://localhost:3000`



### API Endpoints
I created one endpoint that used for the web-app usage and i used cheerio for web scraping and fetching data.

### Extras
I implemented the bonus tasks you mentioned in the exercise.
The app is responsive and in addition, attracts information every minute without human intervention.
